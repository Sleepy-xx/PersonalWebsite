## Overview

Designed a hybrid stateful-stateless system that integrates WhatsApp with advanced AI agents. [cite_start]This bot serves as a personal assistant capable of performing real-world actions through function calling[cite: 1].

## Stack

- **Runtime**: Go (Golang) with WhatsMeow library
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EC2 (t3.micro)
- **AI Agent**: Amazon Bedrock Agents
- **Data Pipeline**: S3 + Lambda

## Key Highlights

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Stateful**: Running Go application on EC2 to maintain WhatsApp socket connection.
- **Stateless**: Offloading heavy processing to Serverless Lambda functions.

### Intelligent Automation
- Utilized **Function Calling** to allow the AI to trigger external APIs (e.g., calendar booking, data lookup).
- Engineered a zero-cost **ETL pipeline** syncing Google Sheets to S3 for dynamic knowledge base updates.
