## Overview

This project architected a scalable serverless solution on AWS to build an Intelligent AI Assistant. [cite_start]It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware responses for enterprise use cases[cite: 1].

## Stack

- **Compute**: AWS Lambda (Serverless)
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway
- **AI Model**: Amazon Bedrock (Claude/Titan)
- **Vector Database**: Amazon OpenSearch / Knowledge Bases
- **Security**: AWS WAF

## Features

### Serverless Architecture
- Event-driven backend using **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
- Zero infrastructure management required.

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- Orchestrated **Bedrock Flows** for handling complex prompt engineering.
- Implemented **RAG architecture** to ground responses in proprietary enterprise data.

### Enterprise Security
- Integrated **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) to protect against common web exploits.
- IAM role-based access control for least privilege.
